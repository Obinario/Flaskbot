## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # This file
â””â”€â”€ templates/
    â””â”€â”€ index.html        # Chat interface template
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main chat interface
- `POST /chat` - Send message to chatbot
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Configuration

The chatbot is configured to use the `markobinario/flaskbot` Gradio space. You can modify the client initialization in `app.py` if you want to use a different model.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection as the app connects to the Gradio API.

2. **Module Not Found**: Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Port Already in Use**: If port 5000 is busy, modify the port in `app.py` or stop the conflicting service.
